⚡ 5. Implementation Steps

### Stage 1 Output Contract (new)

- `HeartbeatService.speechSegments()` now exposes a `SharedFlow<SpeechSegment>` that Stage 2 can collect from inside the service.
- Each `SpeechSegment` bundles:
  - `samples`: mono PCM-16 buffer (16 kHz) covering the full voiced span.
  - `startTimestampNs` / `endTimestampNs`: based on `SystemClock.elapsedRealtimeNanos()` for Perfetto alignment.
  - ~240 ms of pre-roll silence and a minimum voiced duration of ~1.2 s to stabilize speaker verification input.
- Segments are emitted on the service IO scope with backpressure: newest segments replace oldest if Stage 2 lags.
- Perfetto traces log `Heartbeat.Stage1SegmentReady` markers so Stage 2 profiling can correlate verification workload to segment creation.

Set up Foreground Service

Acquire mic permission (RECORD_AUDIO), run as START_STICKY.

Audio Buffer Capture

Use AudioRecord (16 kHz mono 16-bit) with ~30 ms frames.

Run VAD

For each frame, call isSpeech(frame) → emit state changes.

Segment Buffers

Collect speech frames until silence > 500 ms.

Emit Events to Stage 2

Forward buffer via ServiceConnection, LocalBroadcast, or SharedFlow.

Performance Testing

Verify < 100 ms latency and < 10 MB RAM usage.

🔋 6. Power & Performance Tips

Use 16-bit PCM (not float) to halve I/O load.

Avoid explicit wake locks—foreground service notification is the sole keep-alive signal.

Pin the audio coroutine to a single IO thread (no context switching) and keep frame buffers reusable to minimize GC.

Batch transmissions to Stage 2 (e.g., every 3 s speech segment).

Disable downstream stages temporarily when battery < 10 %

Profiling workflow: Android Studio Profiler for CPU/memory (<2% CPU target) and Battery Historian for 8-hour drain validation.

Be Minimal in the Service: The service code itself should be minimal. It should only be responsible for:

Managing the AudioRecord stream.

Running the 3-stage pipeline.

Managing the WebSocket connection.

Do not perform any other work, like disk I/O (beyond logging for the PoC) or heavy computation, in this service.

Do Themes and Stuff Matter?
No, themes do not matter at all.

Themes, XML layouts, and other visual "stuff" are part of your app's UI (User Interface), which runs in an Activity. Your Foreground Service is a background component.

When the user closes your app, the Activity is destroyed, and all those UI elements (and their themes) are unloaded from memory. Your service continues to run completely independently in the background. Its performance is determined by the code it executes (the VAD/SV models), not by what the app looks like.
