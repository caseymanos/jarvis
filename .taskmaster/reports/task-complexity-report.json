			"taskTitle": "Develop Real-Time Voice Session Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider further breaking down latency optimization and wake-word detection into more detailed tasks.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex real-time audio processing and streaming, requiring low latency and integration with multiple technologies (WebRTC, WebSocket, FastAPI, Porcupine). Ensuring performance under various network conditions adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Knowledge Retrieval & Task Routing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider expanding on the reranking logic to include more detailed steps for quantization and threshold setting.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves implementing a hybrid retrieval system with both BM25 and vector search, along with reranking using a cross-encoder. This requires understanding of search algorithms and efficient data handling, adding to the complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Real-Time Synchronization System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider detailing the implementation of optimistic locking and presence indicators further.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves real-time data synchronization using Redis Streams and Temporal, requiring careful handling of concurrency and data consistency. The integration of presence indicators adds additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Collaborative Session Indicators",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks such as WebSocket setup, UI design for indicators, and color assignment logic.",
			"reasoning": "While the task involves real-time updates, the focus is primarily on UI elements and WebSocket communication, which are relatively straightforward but require attention to detail for smooth user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Transcript & Memory Deletion",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider subtasks for implementing keyboard shortcuts, mobile menu integration, and GDPR compliance checks.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves implementing deletion functionality with GDPR compliance, which is straightforward but requires careful handling of data propagation and compliance verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Presence Awareness Feature",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider expanding on the UI design and network health monitoring aspects.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves real-time presence tracking and event broadcasting, requiring integration with Redis/Upstash and WebSockets. Ensuring accuracy and responsiveness adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure State Persistence Across Sessions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider detailing the implementation of offline queue replay and multi-device support.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves ensuring session state persistence and continuity across devices, requiring integration with Durable Objects and Postgres. Handling reconnections and multi-device scenarios adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy Application Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks such as frontend deployment, backend deployment, and scalability testing.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves deploying frontend and backend services with scalability considerations. While the deployment itself is straightforward, ensuring performance under load adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Data Model for Missions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Consider subtasks for table creation, data ingestion, and retrieval optimization.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves setting up a data model and ensuring efficient data ingestion and retrieval. While the database setup is straightforward, ensuring data integrity and performance requires careful planning."
